# JAXChange - Jamaican Cryptocurrency Platform

## Project Overview
JAXChange is a simplified cryptocurrency purchase platform specifically for Jamaican residents. The platform handles all technical complexity while users simply buy cryptocurrency through an intuitive interface, generating revenue through a 1% service fee plus optional signup fees.

**Target Market**: Jamaican residents aged 18-65 seeking straightforward cryptocurrency access
**Value Proposition**: "Buy cryptocurrency in three taps" without exchange account management or wallet setup

## Technology Stack

### Backend
- **Runtime**: Node.js 20+ with Express.js
- **Database**: PostgreSQL 15+ (primary), Redis 7+ (cache/sessions)
- **Authentication**: JWT with refresh token rotation
- **API Documentation**: OpenAPI 3.0 with Swagger UI
- **Message Broker**: Redis Streams

### Frontend
- **Mobile**: React Native (iOS 14+, Android 8+)
- **Web**: Next.js Progressive Web App with SSR
- **UI Framework**: React Native Elements / Tailwind CSS

### Infrastructure
- **Cloud**: AWS (ECS Fargate, RDS, ElastiCache, S3, CloudFront)
- **Monitoring**: CloudWatch with custom metrics
- **CI/CD**: Docker containers with blue-green deployment

## Architecture

### Microservices Structure
1. **User Management Service**: Registration, KYC, account management
2. **Exchange Integration Service**: Price aggregation, order routing
3. **Payment Processing Service**: Bank integration, transaction processing
4. **Wallet Management Service**: Cryptocurrency custody, balance tracking
5. **Compliance Service**: AML monitoring, regulatory reporting
6. **Notification Service**: Email, SMS, push notifications
7. **Analytics Service**: User behavior, platform metrics

### Database Schema (Core Tables)
```sql
-- User Management
users (user_id, email, phone, created_at, status, referral_code)
user_profiles (user_id, first_name, last_name, date_of_birth, address)
user_verification (user_id, kyc_status, verification_level, verified_at)

-- Transactions
orders (order_id, user_id, type, crypto_symbol, amount, price, status)
transactions (txn_id, order_id, exchange_id, amount, fees, status)
user_balances (user_id, crypto_symbol, available_balance, reserved_balance)

-- Market Data
exchanges (exchange_id, name, api_endpoint, status, supported_pairs)
market_prices (symbol, exchange_id, bid_price, ask_price, timestamp)
```

## Exchange Integrations

### Priority Order
1. **Binance** (primary) - Highest liquidity, competitive fees
2. **Kraken** (secondary) - Enhanced security, backup liquidity
3. **Regional exchanges** (tertiary) - Local currency support

### Implementation Pattern
```javascript
// Exchange adapter pattern for seamless integration
class ExchangeAdapter {
  async getBestPrice(symbol, amount, side) {
    // Price aggregation across exchanges
    // Consider fees, slippage, execution speed
  }
}
```

## Payment Integration

### Jamaican Banking Partners
- **First Global Bank** (primary) - Crypto transaction support
- **Republic Bank** (secondary) - Wire transfer rates

### Payment Methods
- Bank transfers (1-3 day processing)
- Credit/Debit cards (instant, 2-4% fees)
- Mobile payments (local services)

## Security Requirements

### Multi-Layer Security
- **API**: Rate limiting (100 req/min), HMAC-SHA256 signing
- **Wallets**: Multi-sig (2-of-3), HSM integration, 5% hot wallet limit
- **Users**: 2FA (TOTP/SMS), biometric auth, device fingerprinting
- **Data**: AES-256 encryption, TLS 1.3, end-to-end encryption

### Compliance
